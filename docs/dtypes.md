# DataTypes

There are two main datatypes in ListLib:

* List
* NumList

`List`s are the more basic between the two because they add a relatively minimal functionality to regular tables such as manipulation (reverse, replace, etc.) and utility (find, slice, etc.). Lists allow values of any datatype.

`NumList`s, as they may imply, are inherited from Lists, but with the added restriction of only numbers. This allows for various mathamatical funtions such as sum, product, min/max, and stats.

More datatypes may be added in the future if necessary.
