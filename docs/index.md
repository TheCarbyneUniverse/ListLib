ListLib is a powerful library that wraps regular Luau tables and adds much more functionality to them. Current Luau tables are very limited and don't cover most common use cases such as reversing, slicing, replacing, and operations.

My original inspiration was Python's Numpy module, although it is much larger than ListLib. This started off with me practicing OOP, until I started drifting towards creating something I wanted to publish.
