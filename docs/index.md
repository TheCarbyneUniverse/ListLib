ListLib is a library that wraps regular Lua tables and adds much more functionality to them. Current Lua tables are very limited and don't cover most common use cases such as reversing, slicing, and replacing.

My original inspiration was Python's Numpy module, which is much larger than ListLib. This started off with me practicing OOP, until I started drifting towards creating something I wanted to publish. 

# The Trio

There are three main datatypes introduced:

* List
* NumList
* Matrix

**List**s are the very basic between the three because they add a relatively basic functionality to regular tables.
